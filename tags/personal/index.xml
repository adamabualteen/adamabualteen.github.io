My Academic Career I am currently a third-year student at the University of South Florida where I pursue a B.S. in Cybersecurity.
In 2020, I graduated Polk State Lakeland Collegiate High School with both a high school diploma and an A.A. from Polk State College in Liberal Arts with Magna Cum Laude distinction. At Lakeland Collegiate, I was the President and Team Captain of our schoolâ€™s Academic Team and competed with other schools in the state of Florida.</description>
